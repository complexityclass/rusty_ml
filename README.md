# Rust-Python ML Algo Comparison

A repository showcasing the implementation of various machine learning algorithms in both Rust and Python. This project serves as a comparative study to explore the efficiency and performance differences between the two languages in the context of machine learning.

## Overview

- **Dual Implementations**: Machine learning algorithms implemented in both Rust and Python for side-by-side comparison.
- **Focus on Learning**: Ideal for those interested in understanding the differences in implementing ML algorithms in a system programming language versus a high-level language.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-python-ml-comparison.git
cd rust-python-ml-comparison
./build.sh
